\section*{Problem 1: Nesting Boxes(CLRS)}
\subsection*{Part 1}
Suppose $\mathbf{x} = (x_1,\dots,x_d)$ nests within $\mathbf{y}=(y_1,\dots,y_d)$, and $\mathbf{y}$ nests
within $\mathbf{z} = (z_1, \dots, z_d)$. Then there exists permutations $\pi_1, \pi_2$ on
$\{1,2,\dots,d\}$ such that
\begin{align}
  \begin{split}
    & x_{\pi_1(1)} < y_1, \dots, x_{\pi_1(d)} < y_d \\
    & y_{\pi_2(1)} < z_1, \dots, y_{\pi_2(d)} < z_d \\
  \end{split}
\end{align}
Given this, we have the following:
\begin{align}
  \begin{split}
    z_1 > y_{\pi_2(1)} > x_{\pi_1(\pi_2(1))}, \cdots, 
    z_d > y_{\pi_2(d)} > x_{\pi_1(\pi_2(d))} \\
  \end{split}
\end{align}
Therefore, we know that $\mathbf{x}$ nests within $\mathbf{z}$, and the nesting relation is
transitive. 

\subsection*{Part 2}
\Algorithm
Let $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}$ be two input $d$-dimensional box. We sort the elements in 
$\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ in ascending order. Then $\mathbf{x}$ nests within $\mathbf{y}$ if and
only if each dimension in sorted $\mathbf{x}$ is smaller than the corresponding dimension in sorted 
$\mathbf{y}$.

\Proof
If each dimension in sorted $\mathbf{x}$ is smaller than the corresponding dimension in sorted
$\mathbf{y}$, then for each $y_i$, we pick $x_{\pi(i)}$ to be $y_i$'s corresponding element in the
sorted $\mathbf{x}$. Obviously we have such a permutation that makes $\mathbf{x}$ nest within
$\mathbf{y}$.

If $\mathbf{x}$ nests within $\mathbf{y}$, let $x^*$ and $y^*$ be the sorted list. Assume that
$x^*_i >= y^*_i$, then we know that 

\begin{align}
  \begin{split}  
  x^*_k \geq y^*_j, \text{for any } k \geq i, j \leq i  \\
  \end{split}
\end{align}
therefore for each $k \geq i$, $x^*_k$ can only corresponding to $y^*_j, j > i$, which is impossible
because the former has $d - i + 1$ elements while the later has only $d-i$ elements. Therefore,
the assumption is wrong, and we have $x^*_i < y^*_i$ for any $1 \leq i \leq d$.

Given above, we can conclude that the proposed algorithm is correct.
