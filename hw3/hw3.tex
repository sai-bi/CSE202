\section*{Problem 1: Nesting Boxes(CLRS)}
\subsection*{Part 1}
Suppose $\mathbf{x} = (x_1,\dots,x_d)$ nests within $\mathbf{y}=(y_1,\dots,y_d)$, and $\mathbf{y}$ nests
within $\mathbf{z} = (z_1, \dots, z_d)$. Then there exists permutations $\pi_1, \pi_2$ on
$\{1,2,\dots,d\}$ such that
\begin{align}
  \begin{split}
    & x_{\pi_1(1)} < y_1, \dots, x_{\pi_1(d)} < y_d \\
    & y_{\pi_2(1)} < z_1, \dots, y_{\pi_2(d)} < z_d \\
  \end{split}
\end{align}
Given this, we have the following:
\begin{align}
  \begin{split}
    z_1 > y_{\pi_2(1)} > x_{\pi_1(\pi_2(1))}, \cdots, 
    z_d > y_{\pi_2(d)} > x_{\pi_1(\pi_2(d))} \\
  \end{split}
\end{align}
Therefore, we know that $\mathbf{x}$ nests within $\mathbf{z}$, and the nesting relation is
transitive. 

\subsection*{Part 2}
\Algorithm
Let $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}$ be two input $d$-dimensional box. We sort the elements in 
$\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ in ascending order. Then $\mathbf{x}$ nests within $\mathbf{y}$ if and
only if each dimension in sorted $\mathbf{x}$ is smaller than the corresponding dimension in sorted 
$\mathbf{y}$.

\Proof
If each dimension in sorted $\mathbf{x}$ is smaller than the corresponding dimension in sorted
$\mathbf{y}$, then for each $y_i$, we pick $x_{\pi(i)}$ to be $y_i$'s corresponding element in the
sorted $\mathbf{x}$. Obviously we have such a permutation that makes $\mathbf{x}$ nest within
$\mathbf{y}$.

If $\mathbf{x}$ nests within $\mathbf{y}$, let $x^*$ and $y^*$ be the sorted list. Assume that
$x^*_i >= y^*_i$, then we know that 

\begin{align}
  \begin{split}  
  x^*_k \geq y^*_j, \text{for any } k \geq i, j \leq i  \\
  \end{split}
\end{align}
therefore for each $k \geq i$, $x^*_k$ can only corresponding to $y^*_j, j > i$, which is impossible
because the former has $d - i + 1$ elements while the later has only $d-i$ elements. Therefore,
the assumption is wrong, and we have $x^*_i < y^*_i$ for any $1 \leq i \leq d$.

Given above, we can conclude that the proposed algorithm is correct.

\Complexity
It takes $O(d\log d)$ time to sort the list, and $O(d)$ time to compare the elements in sorted
list, therefore the time complexity of the proposed algorithm is $O(d\log d)$.

\subsection*{Part 3}
\Algorithm
We regard each box as a vertex, and if a box $A$ nests within box $B$, we add an directed edge from $A$
to $B$. In this way we can get a graph. Then the task of finding the longest sequence turns into the
task of finding longest path in the graph.

First we show that there is no circle in the graph. Assume that there is a circle, let $C$ be a vertex in a
circle, then there is a path from $C$ to $C$. Since nesting relation is transitive, we know that $C$
nests within itself, which forms a contradiction. Therefore the graph has no circle in it.

Given that the graph is directed and acyclic, we could use \textit{Bellman Ford} algorithm to find the longest
path in the graph. Return the length of the longest path in the graph as final result.

\Proof
As mentioned above, the longest sequence of nesting of boxes is equivalent to the longest path in
the constructed graph. Since the graph is directed and acyclic, \textit{Bellman Ford} algorithm is
used to find the longest path. Therefore the correctness of the proposed algorithm is obvious.

\Complexity
To construct the graph, we first sort the elements in each box, which takes $O(nd\log d)$ time, and
afterwards for each pair of boxes we check whether they have nesting relations, which takes
$(dn^2)$. To find the longest path in the graph, \textit{Bellman Ford} algorithm runs in time
$O(V+E)$, where $V$ and $E$ are the number of vertices and edges in graph, and therefore the time
complexity for this step is $O(n^2)$. In conclusion, the time complexity of the proposed algorithm
is $O(dn^2)$.


\section*{Problem 4: Oxen pairing}
\Algorithm
For all oxen in the group, we first pick the strongest ox $p$ and the weakest ox $q$ ($p$ and $q$
must be different), if they 
are able to pull a plow, that is $S_p + S_q \geq P$, then we pair them as a team and delete them
from the group, otherwise we delete the weakest ox from the group. Repeat this procedure until there 
are less than two oxen remaining in the group. Return the number of teams formed as the maximal
number of teams.

\Proof
\textbf{Claim 1}: 
Let $p$ and $q$ be the strongest and weakest ox in the group, if $S_p + S_q < P$,
then $q$ will not be included in any team.

Proof: If $S_p + S_q < P$, then for the weakest ox $q$, for any other ox $x$, we have $S_x + S_q <
S_p + S_q < P$, that is, $q$ cannot be paired with any ox to form a team to pull the plow. Claim 1
is proved.

\vspace{0.3cm}
\textbf{Claim 2}: 
Let $p$ and $q$ be the strongest and weakest ox in the group, if $S_p + S_q \geq P$, let $T_1$ be a
set of teams that can pull the plow and doesn't include pair $(p, q)$, we claim that there exists
$T_2$ which is another set of teams that include pair $(p, q)$ and $|T_2| \geq |T_1|$.

Proof: first if neither $p$ or $q$ is in the teams of $T_1$, then obviously we can add team $(p,
q)$ to team $T_1$ to form $T_2$, and $|T_2| = |T_1| + 1 > |T_1|$.

If $p$ belongs to a team, $q$ doesn't belong to a team in $T_1$, let $(p, x)$ be the team, since 
$S_p + S_q > P$, then obviously we use team $(p, q)$ to replace team $(p, x)$ to form $T_2$, and 
$|T_2| = |T_1|$.


If $q$ belongs to a team, $p$ doesn't belong to a team in $T_1$, similarly, let $(q, x)$ be the team, since 
$S_p + S_q > P$, then obviously we use team $(p, q)$ to replace team $(q, x)$ to form $T_2$, and 
$|T_2| = |T_1|$.

If both $p$ and $q$ belong to teams in $T_1$ and $p, q$ are not in a team, let $(p, x)$, $(q, y)$ be
the teams in $T_1$. We have the following:
\begin{align}
  S_x + S_y \geq S_q + S_y \geq P 
\end{align}
that is we can use $(x, y), (p, q)$ to replace $(p, x), (q, y)$ in $T_1$ to form $T_2$. And $|T_2| =
|T_1|$.
Given above, Claim 2 can be proved.

\vspace{0.3cm}
Following we use induction to prove that the result generate by proposed algorithm is optimal.
For base case, obviously the proposed algorithm is correct for $N <= 2$.  
Assume that the proposed algorithm is optimal when number of oxen is smaller than $N$. Then when
there are $N$ oxen in the group, let $p$ and $q$ be the strongest and weakest ox.

If $S_p + S_q < P$, according to Claim 1, we know that $q$ cannot form team with any other ox. We
can safely remove $q$ from the group, then the problem reduces to the case of $N-1$. By induction,
the proposed algorithm will generate optimal result.

If $S_p + S_q \geq P$, for any solution $T_1$, according to Claim 2, we have a solution $T_2$ that
includes pair $(p, q)$ and $|T_2| \geq |T_1$. Let $T^*$ be the solution generated by proposed
algorithm, then $T*$ must include $(p, q)$, and by induction $T^* - (p, q)$ is an optimal solution for the group
of $N-2$ oxen after removing $p$ and $q$, and $T_2 - (p, q)$ is a valid solution to it. Therefore we
have the following:
\begin{align}
  |T_2| - 1 & \leq |T^*| - 1 \\
  |T_2| & \leq |T^*|
\end{align}
so we have $|T_1| \leq |T_2| \leq |T^*|$. That is $T^*$ is also optimal.

By induction, we know that the proposed algorithm is optimal for all $N$.
