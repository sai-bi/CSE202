\section*{Problem 1: Job scheduling}
\Algorithm
We solve this problem by network flow. For each job $j$, we create a node $v_j$. 
For each processor $i$, we add a node $g_i$.
For each time unit $t_p$ during which at least one of the processor is available, we add a node $u_p$. 
Also we add a source node $s$ and a sink node $t$. 
We add edges and set their capacities as following:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item We add a directed edge between source node $s$ and node $v_j$, and the capacity is set to
    $\ell_j$.
  \item We add a directed edge between processor node $g_i$ and sink node $s$, and the capacity is
    set to $|t_i' - t_i|$.

  \item For each node $v_j$ and $u_p$, if $a_j \leq t_p$ and $d_j > t_p$, we add an edge between $v_j$
    and $u_p$ with a capacity of $1$. In this way, we can guarantee that the job cannot be assigned
    to a processor before it arrives and after the deadline passes. Also by setting capacity to $1$
    we guarantee that a job can only be set to one processor at a time unit.  
  \item For each node $u_p$ and $g_i$, if $t_i \leq t_p < t_i'$, we add an edge between $u_p$ and
    $g_i$, and the capacity of the edge is set to $1$. 
\end{enumerate}

Given above formulation, we can find the maximum flow of the network with \textit{Ford-Fulkerson}
method. If the capacity of the maximum
flow is equal to the sum of lengths of all jobs $\sum_{j} \ell_j$, then we know that the jobs can
all be completed. Otherwise, the jobs cannot be completed. 

To determine a proper scheduling when the
jobs can all be completed, suppose there is an edge with capacity $1$ between $v_j$ and $u_p$, and
there is also an edge between $u_p$ and $g_i$ with capacity $1$,  
we know at time $t_p$ that job $v_j$ can be assigned to processor $g_i$. Afterwards we delete these
two edges and determine scheduling in similar ways for remaining jobs and time units.

\Proof
First we prove that an integral flow through the graph produces a valid scheduling. We have the
following:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The edge between source node $s$ and the node corresponding to job $v_j$ has the capacity equal
    to the length of the job, the flow through the job node won't exceed the length of the job. 
  \item We only add edge between job $v_j$ and the time unit $t_p$ where $a_j \leq t_p$ and $d_j > t_p$, so the
    job can only be assigned to a time unit that is after its arrival time and before its deadline.
    Also since we only add edge between $u_p$ and $g_i$ when processor $i$ is available at time $u_p$,
    which makes sure that a job can only be assigned to a processor at a time when the processor is
    available. By setting capacity of edge between $v_j$ and $u_p$ and edge between $u_p$ and $g_i$
    to $1$, we guarantee that a job can only be assign to a processor at a time unit. 
  \item By setting the capacity of edge between $g_i$ and $t$ to the length of interval where the
    processor is available, we guarantee that the scheduling will not exceed the available interval
    of processors.
\end{enumerate}
Given above proofs, we know that all constraints in the problems are met. So the flow produced
must be a valid scheduling.  

Suppose that $m$ is the size of an integral flow through the graph, then the total number of time
units used to do all jobs is also $m$. To finish all the jobs, the total number of time units needed
would be $T = \sum_{j}\ell_j$. Obviously $m$ cannot be larger than $T$ since the sum of capacity
of edges from source $s$ to $v_j$ is $T$. If $m < T$, it means that not all jobs have been finished.       
If $m = T$, it means that the time used to finish job $v_j$ must be equal to $\ell_j$, that is, all
jobs are finished.

In conclusion, we have proved that the proposed algorithm is correct.

\section*{Problem 2: Graph cohesiveness}
\Algorithm
We construct a graph $G^*$ as following:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item For each vertex $v_i$ in $G$, we also add a corresponding vertex $v_i$ to $G^*$.
  \item For each edge $e_ij$ in $G$, we add a vertex $v_{ij}$ to $G^*$.  
  \item We add a source node $s$ and a sink node $t$ to $G^*$.
  \item
