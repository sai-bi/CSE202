\section*{Problem 1: Hamiltonian Path}
\Algorithm
Let $V'$ be a set of vertices statisfying $V' \subset V$. We use $M(V', i, j)$ to denote whether
there is a Hamiltonian path from $v_i \in V'$ to $v_j \in V'$ in the graph that only contains vertices in $V'$ and
edges between vertices in $V'$. For initialization, starting from the set $V'$ that contains only $1$ vertex, we set 
$M(V', i, i), |V'| = \{v_i\}$ to \textit{true}. For others, we set $M(V', i, j)$ to true if and only if there exists
a vertex $v_k \in V' - {v_i}$ and there is an edge between $v_i$ and $v_k$, and there is an
Hamiltonian path from $v_k$ to $v_j$, that is $M(V' - \{v_i\}, k, j)$ is true.
And there is a Hamiltonian path from $v_1$ to $v_n$ if and
only if $M(V, 1, n)$ is true.  

\Proof
We prove the following claim: $M(V', i, j)$ is true if and only if there exists a vertex $v_k \in 
V' - \{v_i\}$ and there is an edge between $v_i$ and $v_k$ and also there is a Hamiltonian path from
$v_k$ to $v_j$, that is $M(V' - \{v_i\}, k, j)$ is true.  

If there is a vertex $v_k$, and there is an edge between $v_i$ and $v_k$, and there is a Hamiltonian
path from $v_k$ to $v_j$. Obviously there is a Hamiltonian path in $V'$, and we can get it by
simply add the edge $(v_i, v_k)$ to the Hamiltonian path from $v_k$ to $v_j$.   

Conversely, if $M(V', i, j)$ is true, that is, there is a Hamiltonian path from $v_i$ to $v_j$ in
$V'$, suppose that in the Hamiltonian path, the vertex that comes after $v_i$ is $v_k$. Obviously
$v_k \in V' - \{v_i\}$, there is an edge between $v_i$ and $v_k$, and the path from $v_k$ to $v_j$
is a Hamiltonian path of set $V' - \{v_i\}$. That is, $M(V' - \{v_i\}, k, j)$ is true.  

In summary the claim is true. By induction we can easily prove the correctness of the proposed
algorithm.

\Complexity
There are in total $2^n$ subsets, so there are $2^n \cdot n \cdot n$ triples like $M(V', i, j)$.
To determine whether $M(V', i, j)$ is true, it takes $O(n)$ time since for each $v_k \in V' -
\{v_i\}$ we need to check whether there is an edge between $v_i$ and $v_k$ and also the value of 
$M(V' - \{v_i\}, k, j)$. Therefore the time complexity of the proposed algorithm is $O(2^n \cdot
n^3)$.

\section*{Problem 2}
Let $r$ be the root of the tree. For each node $v$ in the tree, let $T_v$ be the subtree rooted at 
that node. Let $MC(v, k)$ be the maximum cut of subtree $T_v$ when the set that contains $v$ has
exactly $k$ nodes. Therefore we are trying the determine the value of $MC(r, \frac{n}{2})$.

For a leaf node $v$, obviously we know that $k$ can only be $1$, therefore $MC(v, 1) = 0$ for every
leaf node $v$.

For a non-leaf node $v$, suppose $v$ has only one child $u$. Let $(A, B)$ be a maximum tree cut for
$T_v$ and $A$ is the set that contains $v$. We have two possible cases:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item If $u \in A$, in this case we must have $MC(v, k) = MC(u, k-1)$.
  \item If $u \notin A$, in this case we must have $MC(v, k) = c(v, u) + MC(u, |T_u| - k + 1)$, where $|T_u|$
    is the number of vertices in subtree $T_u$, and $c(v, u)$ is the cost of edge between $v$ and
    $u$. 
\end{enumerate}
Therefore, $MC(v, k)$ is calculated as following:
\begin{align}
MC(v, k) = \max(MC(u, k-1), MC(u, |T_u| - k + 1) + c(v, u))
\end{align}

% \begin{align}
% E(T_k, q) = & \frac{1}{N_T}\sum_{i=1}^{m}\big[S_{k}(p_i) - T_k(q)\big]^2 + \alpha \cdot \frac{1}{N_S}\sum_{j=1}^{n}\big[\hat{S}_{k}(p_j) - T_k(q)\big]^2  \\
% & + \lambda \sum_{p=1}^{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i[q] \big(\mathcal{P} _p(T_i)[q] - M_p[q] \big)^2
% \end{align}

% \begin{align}
% \frac{\partial E}{\partial T_k(q)} = 0
% \end{align}

% \begin{align}
% \frac{\partial E}{\partial M_k(q)} = 0
% \end{align}
