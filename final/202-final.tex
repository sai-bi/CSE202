\section*{Problem 1: Always Non-negative Path}
\Algorithm
The algorithm works as following:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item For each vertex $v$, We use $P(v)$ to denote the maximum weight path from source $s$ to $v$.
  Initially we set $P(s) = 0$, and for all other nodes we set $P$ to $-\infty$. 
\item  \label{list:1} And we update $M(v)$
    in a manner similar to \textit{Bellman-Ford} algorithm, that is, we iterate over all edges $e \in E$
    for $|V|$ times, and for any edge $e = (u, v)$, if $P(u) + w(e) \geq 0$, we update value of $P(v) =
    \max(P(v), P(u) + w(e))$.
  \item Apply \textit{Depth-First-Search} (DFS) algorithm to find a positive weight cycle and for
    all vertex $v$ on the cycle, set their $P(v) = +\infty$.
  \item Repeat Step~\ref{list:1} to update value of $P$ for each vertex.
  \item There is a non-negative path from $s$ to $t$ if and only if $P(t) \geq 0$.  
\end{enumerate}


\begin{minted}[frame=lines, framesep=2mm, escapeinside=??, mathescape=true]{cpp}
function Main()
Input: Graph G = (V, E), s, t
Output: bool // whether there is a always non-negative path from s to t

P(v) = ?$-\infty$? for any ?$v \in V, v \neq s$?
P(s) = 0;

BellmanFord();
FindCycle();
BellmanFord();

return P(t) ?$\geq$? 0;
\end{minted}


\begin{minted}[frame=lines, framesep=2mm, escapeinside=??, mathescape=true]{cpp}
function BellmanFord()
for i = 1 : |V| {
  for edge (u, v)  in E {
    if P(u) + w(u, v) ?$\geq$? 0 {
      P(v) = max(P(u) + w(u, v), P(v)) 
    }
  }
}

\end{minted}

\begin{minted}[frame=lines, framesep=2mm, escapeinside=??, mathescape=true]{cpp}
function FindCycle()
S = new stack();
S.push((s, 0));

while ~S.empty() {
  (v, m) = S.pop();
  mark v as visited
  for all edges (v, u) in E {
    if P(v)
  }
}

\end{minted}

\section*{Problem 2: Pivoting vertices}
\Algorithm
Let $T = (V, E)$. For a vertex $v \in V$, let $a$ be a ancestor of $v$. Let $T_v$ be the subtree
rooted at $v$. Let $C_v = \{u | u \text{ is a child of } v\}$. Let $w(v)$ be the weight of $v$.

We use $W(v, a)$ to denote the cost of subtree $T_v$ when $v$'s closest pivot ancestor is
$a$. And $W(v, v)$ refers to the cost of subtree $T_v$ when $v$ is a pivot.   
We have the following:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $W(v, v) = w(v) + \sum_{u \in C_v} \min(W(u, v), W(u, u))$. 
  \item $W(v, a) = w(v) - w(a) + \sum_{u \in C_v} \min( W(u, u), W(u, a))$, where $a$ is an ancestor of
    $v$, and $a$ is a pivot vertex.
\end{enumerate}

For base case, if $v$ is a leaf node, we have $W(v, v) = w(v)$, and $W(v, a) = w(v) - w(a)$. We
could go from leaf node and go to upper level and calculate the value of $W(v, a)$ for each
descendent-ancestor pair $v$ and $a$. 

Finally we return $W(r, r)$ where $r$ is the root node, as the minimum total cost.

To get a optimal assignment of vertices, we make root $r$ a pivot vertex. And then we backtrack
to determine the optimal assignment of other vertices, and assume that $W(u, v) < W(u, u)$ we will
make $u$ a regular vertex, otherwise we will make $u$ a pivot vertex.  
 
\Proof
Following we prove the correctness of the induction relationship. 

\textbf{Claim 1:}
$W(v, v) = w(v) + \sum_{u \in C_v} \min(W(u, v), W(u, u))$. 

\textbf{Proof:}
If $v$ is a pivot vertex, obviously for any $u \in C_v$, if $u$ is a pivot vertex,
then the cost of subtree $T_u$ would be $W(u, u)$. If $u$ is a regular vertex, the cost of subtree
would be $W(u, v)$ because now $v$ is the closest pivot ancestor of $u$. So we have 
$W(v, v) = w(v) + \sum_{u \in C_v} \min(W(u, v), W(u, u))$. 

\textbf{Claim 2:}
 $W(v, a) = w(v) - w(a) + \sum_{u \in C_v} \min( W(u, u), W(u, a))$, where $a$ is the closest ancestor of
 $v$.

\textbf{Proof:}
In this case, obviously $v$ is not a pivot vertex, otherwise it turns into the case of $W(v, v)$.
Then the cost of $v$ would be $w(v) - w(a)$. And for any $u \in C_v$, if $u$ is a regular vertex,
the cost of subtree $T_u$ would be $W(u, a)$ since $a$ is the closest ancestor of $u$ now. And if 
$u$ is a pivot vertex, the cost of subtree $T_u$ would be $W(u, u)$. To minimize the cost, obviously we have  
$W(v, a) = w(v) - w(a) + \sum_{u \in C_v} \min( W(u, u), W(u, a))$.

In addition, we can safely assume that root $r$ is a pivot vertex. Because assigning $r$ to be a
regular vertex will not reduce the cost of $r$ since $r$ has no ancestors, and will also not reduce
cost of any of its descendents. 

Therefore $M(r, r)$ must be the minimum cost.  

\Complexity
For a vertex $a$, to calculate $W(v, a)$, the time complexity is $O(|C_v|)$. Therefore to calculate
$W$ for all  descendent-ancestor pairs, the time complexity is $O(|V|^2)$.


\section*{Problem 3: Electronic message transmission systems}
\Algorithm
We build a graph $G = (V, E)$ as following:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Add a source node $s$ and a sink node $t$ to $G$.
  \item For each site $i$, we add a node $v_i$ to $G$.
  \item For each pair of sites $i, j, i\neq j$, we add a node $v_{ij}$ to $G$
  \item Add an edge from $s$ to $v_{ij}$ with capacity $s_{ij}$.
  \item Add an edge from $v_i$ to $t$ with capacity $c_i$.
  \item Add an edge from $v_{ij}$ to $v_i$ with capacity $+\infty$.
  \item Add an edge from $v_{ij}$ to $v_j$ with capacity $+\infty$.
\end{enumerate}

Given graph $G$, we apply \textit{Push-relabel} algorithm to find a minimum cut $C = (S, T)$ of $G$,
where $s \in S, t \in T$. Then the capacity of $C$ is the maximum sum of the edge
revenues less the vertex costs. And the site we choose are those in the set $\{v_i | v_i \in S\}$ 

\Proof
\textbf{Claim 1:}: $v_{ij} \in S$ if and only if $v_i \in S$ and $v_j \in S$.

\textbf{Proof:} If $v_{ij} \in S$, assume $v_i \not\in S$, then $v_i \in T$. Since there is an edge
from $v_{ij}$ to $v_i$ with capacity $+\infty$, obviously we know that the capacity of cut $C$ will
be $+\infty$, which is not minimum and contradicts with the fact. Therefore $v_i$ must be in $S$.
Similarly we could prove that $v_j \in S$.

If $v_i \in S, v_j \in S$, to get to $v_i$ and $v_j$ from $s$, we have to go through $v_{ij}$, since
$v_i$ and $v_j$ are only connected to $v_{ij}$. Therefore $v_ij \in S$.

Given Claim 1, we know that the only edges from $S$ to $T$ are either edges from $s$ to $v_{ij} \in
T$, or edges from $v_i \in S$ to $t$. Therefore the capacity of the cut could be calculated as
following:

\begin{align}
  |C| & = \sum_{v_{ij} \in T} c(s, v_{ij}) + \sum_{v_i \in S} c(v_i, t) \\
  & = \sum_{v_{ij} \in V} c(s, v_{ij}) - \sum_{v_{ij} \in S} c(s, v_{ij}) + \sum_{v_i \in S} c(v_i,
  t) 
\end{align}

Since $\sum_{v_{ij} \in V} c(s, v_{ij})$ is fixed, by minimizing $|C|$, we are minimizing 
$-\sum_{v_{ij} \in S} c(s, v_{ij}) + \sum_{v_i \in S} c(v_i,t)$, which is exactly the set of
vertices that achieves maximal sum of the edge
revenues less the vertex costs.
  
\Complexity
To build the graph, the time complexity is $(|V|^2)$. And to find the minimum cut with
\textit{Push-relabel} algorithm, the time complexity is $O(|V|^2|E|)$. Therefore the time complexity
of the proposed algorithm is $O(|V|^4)$.

\section*{Problem 4: Maximizing the benefit of unreachable nodes}
\Algorithm
First we construct a new graph $G' = (V', E')$ as following:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Initially we create a copy of $G$ and make it $G'$.
  \item Change node $r$ to a source node $s$ in $G'$,  
  \item Add a sink node $t$ to $G'$.
  \item For any edge $e'$ in $G'$ set its capacity equal to $c_e$.
  \item For any node $v \in G', v \neq s, v\neq t$, add an edge from $v$ to $t$ with capacity
    equal to $b_v$.
\end{enumerate}

Given graph $G'$, we calculate a minimum cut $C = (S, T)$ where $s \in S, t \in T$, and then the set
of edges attackers should destroy are $A = \{(u, v) | u \in S, v \in S, (u, v) \in E \}$. 

%\Proof
% We are trying to maximize the benifits of disonnecting vertices less the costs of destorying edges.
% Let $(S, T)$ a cut of graph $G'$, if we destory all edges in  $A = \{(u, v) | u \in S, v \in S, (u,
% v) \in E' \}$, then the cost is $C(S, T)$, which is the capacity of the cut. And the benefit
% is the sum of benifits of vertices disconnected from $s$ ($r$). Therefore we have:
% \begin{align} 
  % & \max\sum_{v \in T} b_v  - C(S, T) \\
  % \Leftrightarrow & \min C(S, T) - \sum_{v \in T} b_v \\
  % \Leftrightarrow & \min C(S, T) + \sum_{v \in S} b_v 
% \end{align}
\Proof
By definition of graph cut, we have:
\begin{align}
  C(S, T) = \sum_{(u, v) \in E', u \in S, v\in T} c(u, v)
\end{align}
Here there are two kinds of edges. The first kind of edges are those exist in $E$, and we denote
them as $E_1$, and the second kind of edges are the edges we add from $v$ to $t$, and we denote them
as $E_2$. Therefore we have:
\begin{align}
  C(S, T) & = \sum_{(u, v) \in E', u \in S, v\in T} c(u, v) \\
  & = \sum_{(u, v) \in E_1} c(u, v) + \sum_{(v, t) \in E_2} b_v \\
  & = \sum_{(u, v) \in E_1} c(u, v) + \sum_{v \in S} b_v \\
  & = \sum_{(u, v) \in E_1} c(u, v) + \sum_{v \in V', v \neq s, v \neq t} b_v  - \sum_{v \in T} b_v \\
\end{align}
Therefore by minimizing $C(S, T)$, since $\sum_{v \in V', v \neq s, v \neq t} b_v$ is fixed,  
we are minimizing $ \sum_{(u, v) \in E_1} c(u, v) - \sum_{v \in T} b_v$, that is, we are maximizing 
$ -\sum_{(u, v) \in E_1} c(u, v) + \sum_{v \in T} b_v$. For any $v \in T$, it is disconnected from
$r = s$. Therefore $\sum_{v \in T} b_v$ are the benefits of vertices disconnected from $s$, while
$\sum_{(u, v) \in E_1} c(u, v)$ is the costs of destroying edges. Hence by destroying edges in 
$E_1$, or more formally destroying edges in  $A = \{(u, v) | u \in S, v\in T, (u, v) \in E\}$, we are
maximizing the benefits of disconnecting vertices less the costs of destroying edges.  

\Complexity
To construct the graph, the time complexity is $O(|V| + |E|)$. And to find the minimum cut in $G'$,
we apply \textit{Push-relabel} algorithm, and the complexity is $O(|V|^2|E|)$. Therefore the time
complexity of the proposed algorithm is $O(|V|^4)$.
